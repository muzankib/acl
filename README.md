# ACL: A Price Discovery Protocol for Digital Property Rights

1. Top-down authoritarian property rights was an inhibitor to development and innovation, i.e. a few hold all the rights and reap the returns, the many provide the labour but receive none of the returns, because it removed the incentive to develop the property you owned as your returns would be captured by somebody else and you'd be worse off than the person who did not exert a similar effort but received the same return as you
2. Developing and dispersing property rights was useful because incentives: pairing agency with privatised returns provides the incentive to create
3. NFTs are property rights for the web
4. But web or networked property is difficult to value because its never been scarce and people have a hard time equating value to an asset that can be procured for free, like a jpeg or a file
5. As a result, value in web property is clustered around those with a strong resemblence to physical assets where physical scarcity creates value, i.e. art, collectibles, etc. 
6. This, coupled with the fact that the market for web property is supply-led, i.e. suppliers must mint NFTs before they can be valued by the market, under-utilises the latent resources that have been slowly developed and dispersed across the web over the past 30 years and has a warping effect on the understanding, valuation, and development of web property
7. My hypothesis is, if everything on the web was already an NFT, i.e. the property rights can be assumed as they were during the homesteading movement, we would see a demand-driven approach to web property which would be broader and less volatile, there would be an exponential growth in the development of web property and the returns to those who invest their time to develop them
8. But, most importantly, everything would get a price. And price is one of the most important pieces of information in the development of an efficient market for web property.
9. With ACL, the **whole** web is open for business.
